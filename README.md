# Description:

When I started doing some linear algebra in C, it came to me as a surprise to see there are so few tutorials for BLAS, LAPACK, and other fundamental APIs. Even though they are somehow the building blocks of many other libraries. So, I started collecting all the examples I could find all over the internet for BLAS, LAPACK, CLAPACK, LAPACKE, ATLAS, OpenBLAS ... in this Github repo. Well, I should warn you that as a mechanical engineer, I have little experience managing such a repo, and it might first seem a complete mess to you guys. However, if you manage to get over the mess, you will find all kinds of examples and instructions that might help. I have tried the most, and the ones that do not compile I have mentioned. I have modified many of them to be compilable with GNU compilers (`gcc`, `g++`, and `gfortran`). I have made `MakeFile`s, which you can read to learn how you can call individual FORTRAN routines in a C or C++ program. I have also put some installation instructions for macOS and Linux (sorry, windows guys!). I want to make sure if you are a C developer, you can use any of these libraries without any problems, regardless of your platform or hardware.



# Issues:


1. not able to compile ATLAS on mac OS X. a bug report was made on sourceforce: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/261/
2. for some of the BLAS and CBLAS examples the -lgfortran is required to compile. I don't know why! (on mac OS X you need to install gfortran and then look for libgfortran.dylib and link against it while compiling)
3. Change the name of the repository from Cmathtuts to something more relevant including linear algebra
4. When to use Fortran or FORTRAN?



# To do:

1. make compiling/installation for all libraries for different platforms
  1. windows
  2. macOS
  3. GNU/linux
2. check the Makefiles on other platforms(tested only on mac OS X)


# Ideas:

1. Adding OpenCL implementations of the APIs
